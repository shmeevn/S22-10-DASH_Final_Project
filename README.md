# S22-10-DASH_Final_Project
This repo contains the finalized S22-10-DASH project files for predicting solar panel output using Keras LSTM.

# Usage Information
  >python testbench.py save weather
  
This will start the program, train a new model using the parameters specified in the testbench, and save the trained model in the programs directory.

  >python testbench.py load weather
  
This will start the program, load a previous trained model, and start the main program loop which generates figures constantly.

The output of the program can be viewed by opening the figpage.html file in a browser while the program is running in load mode.
